### Why Another JavaScript Framework?

KISS. Keep it simple stupid. With so many JS UI frameworks popping up, it is hard to keep up to date with all the new front-end libraries. Most of them are over complicated, requires pre-compilers, and take ages just to set them up. That is why WillCore.UI was born, a simple but yet powerful framework was needed to not only build websites, but also PWAs with offline functionality.

###### WillCore.UI has a simple API and can be learned in a day (disclaimer: excluding people with impaired cognitive functionality).
